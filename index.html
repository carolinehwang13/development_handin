      <h2>Part 1: Competitive Analysis</h2>
      <p>
        To see which list features I wanted to include in my own aggregator, I
        first wanted to compare aggregators on existing websites. To do this, I
        chose 3 websites with favoriting functionality: Spotify (browser),
        Pinterest, and YouTube. Below I break down the comparisons I found
        between the 3 websites.
      </p>

      <table>
        <tr>
          <th></th>
          <th>Spotify</th>
          <th>Twitter</th>
          <th>YouTube</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Visible on profile</td>
          <td>No</td>
          <td>Yes</td>
          <td>No</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Message/animation after favoriting</td>
          <td>Yes</td>
          <td>Yes</td>
          <td>Yes</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Dislike function</td>
          <td>No</td>
          <td>No</td>
          <td>Yes</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Shows how many other people liked</td>
          <td>No</td>
          <td>Yes</td>
          <td>Yes</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Represented as positive icon (heart, thumbs up)</td>
          <td>No</td>
          <td>Yes</td>
          <td>Yes</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Stored in chronological order</td>
          <td>Yes</td>
          <td>Yes</td>
          <td>Yes</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Don't have to switch pages to like</td>
          <td>Yes</td>
          <td>Yes</td>
          <td>Yes</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>
        <b>Likes: </b><br />Based on my own experiences, I found some of the
        features in the above table more successful than others. I enjoyed when
        the websites represented the "like" button as a heart or thumbs up
        because it lets me know as a user which button I need to press to
        favorite something. This is something YouTube and Twitter have that
        Spotify does not. Spotify's is simply a "+", which can be confusing
        because it is not clear what list you are adding the song to. Another
        feature I enjoyed was some kind of animation or sign that I had
        successfully liked something. This is something all the websites had,
        and it is helpful in letting the user know the state of the system. I
        also thought all 3 websites were pretty straightforward in terms of
        finding the like button because once you had the post/song/video in
        front of you, it only takes one click to like it. <br /><b>Dislikes:</b
        ><br />One factor that might be confusing for users is the dislike
        functionality on YouTube. This is because if you dislike a video, it
        does not save the video anywhere, making it difficult to unlike it.
        Additionally, the dislike button is right next to the like button, which
        can make it easy to accidentally dislike a video. Some of the more
        subjective features are making your likes visible on your profile and
        showing how many likes something has. Visible likes can be good if you
        want to share things you find interesting, but can be bad if a user
        wants to keep their likes more private. Showing how many likes something
        has can be good to show how popular it is, but can be bad if it causes
        the user to prematurely judge how good a post/video/song is. <br /><b
          >What I want to incorporate:</b
        ><br />
        Based on this comparison analysis, there are four main features I want
        to focus on implementing in my own aggregator.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>A one-click adding process</li>
        <li>
          Some sign that the button has been clicked and the item successfully
          added
        </li>
        <li>An easy way to remove from the list</li>
        <li>
          Storing favorited items in a list in the order they were liked (newest
          to oldest)
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Part 2: Functionality</h2>
      <p>
        To demonstrate the use of an aggregator, I chose to replicate an online
        plant store. My plant store (Plant Paradise) has an inventory of plants
        that users can add to their cart. Since some users may not know exactly
        what they are looking for, the online store allows them to sort based on
        climate, ease of care, and alphebetically. Additionally, if users
        know a specific category of plant they want, they can filter through the
        inventory based on climate, family, and size. Users can add multiple of
        each plant to their cart and remove if they change their mind. Below is
        a quick mockup of Plant Paradise.
      </p>
      <img
        id="mockup"
        src="./assets/Development-1.jpg"
        alt="Mockup of Plant Paradise"
      />
      <p>(Note that some of the features of the mockup are different in the final product!)</p>
      <p>
        The key features of Plant Paradise are the sort, filter, add to cart,
        and remove from cart functionalities. Once users click the "sort"
        button, they will see a dropdown menu of features to sort by and can
        choose one at a time. When the user clicks on the climate or difficulty filters, they will see a
        dropdown menu of features to filter by. Users can
        click the add button to add to their cart. Inside the cart, they can continue to add multiple of the plant to the cart (which will display the current amount in the cart)
        or delete it.
