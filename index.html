      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        In order to practice creating a reactive website, I created a site
        called "Plant Paradise" whose display changes based on user actions.
        Plant Paradise is an online plant shop that allows users to sort and
        filter through its inventory and add/remove plants to their cart. Going
        into this project, the key aspects that I wanted to focus on were
        becoming familiar with React applications, using states in React, and using components as types of objects. Additionally, before I began making my own reactive website, I carried out a competative analysis of 3 sites with similar aggregator features to inspire the functionality of my webpage.

      <h2>Part 1: Competitive Analysis</h2>
      <p>
        To see which list features I wanted to include in my own aggregator, I
        first wanted to compare aggregators on existing websites. To do this, I
        chose 3 websites with favoriting functionality: Spotify (browser),
        Pinterest, and YouTube. Below I break down the comparisons I found
        between the 3 websites.
      </p>

      <table>
        <tr>
          <th></th>
          <th>Spotify</th>
          <th>Twitter</th>
          <th>YouTube</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Visible on profile</td>
          <td>No</td>
          <td>Yes</td>
          <td>No</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Message/animation after favoriting</td>
          <td>Yes</td>
          <td>Yes</td>
          <td>Yes</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Dislike function</td>
          <td>No</td>
          <td>No</td>
          <td>Yes</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Shows how many other people liked</td>
          <td>No</td>
          <td>Yes</td>
          <td>Yes</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Represented as positive icon (heart, thumbs up)</td>
          <td>No</td>
          <td>Yes</td>
          <td>Yes</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Stored in chronological order</td>
          <td>Yes</td>
          <td>Yes</td>
          <td>Yes</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Don't have to switch pages to like</td>
          <td>Yes</td>
          <td>Yes</td>
          <td>Yes</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>
        <b>Likes: </b><br />Based on my own experiences, I found some of the
        features in the above table more successful than others. I enjoyed when
        the websites represented the "like" button as a heart or thumbs up
        because it lets me know as a user which button I need to press to
        favorite something. This is something YouTube and Twitter have that
        Spotify does not. Spotify's is simply a "+", which can be confusing
        because it is not clear what list you are adding the song to. Another
        feature I enjoyed was some kind of animation or sign that I had
        successfully liked something. This is something all the websites had,
        and it is helpful in letting the user know the state of the system. I
        also thought all 3 websites were pretty straightforward in terms of
        finding the like button because once you had the post/song/video in
        front of you, it only takes one click to like it. <br /><b>Dislikes:</b
        ><br />One factor that might be confusing for users is the dislike
        functionality on YouTube. This is because if you dislike a video, it
        does not save the video anywhere, making it difficult to unlike it.
        Additionally, the dislike button is right next to the like button, which
        can make it easy to accidentally dislike a video. Some of the more
        subjective features are making your likes visible on your profile and
        showing how many likes something has. Visible likes can be good if you
        want to share things you find interesting, but can be bad if a user
        wants to keep their likes more private. Showing how many likes something
        has can be good to show how popular it is, but can be bad if it causes
        the user to prematurely judge how good a post/video/song is. <br /><b
          >What I want to incorporate:</b
        ><br />
        Based on this comparison analysis, there are three main features I want
        to focus on implementing in my own aggregator.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>A one-click adding process</li>
        <li>
          Some sign that the button has been clicked and the item successfully
          added (and the number of times)
        </li>
        <li>An easy way to remove from the list</li>
      </ol>
    </div>
    <div id="part2">
      <h2>Part 2: Functionality</h2>
      <p>
        To demonstrate the use of an aggregator, I chose to replicate an online
        plant store. My plant store (Plant Paradise) has an inventory of plants
        that users can add to their cart. Since some users may not know exactly
        what they are looking for, the online store allows them to filter
        inventory by climate and ease of care. Additionally, users can sort
        alphebetically and by price. Users can add multiple of each plant to
        their cart and remove if they change their mind. Below is a quick mockup
        of Plant Paradise.
      </p>
      <img id="mockup" src="./assets/Development-1.jpg" alt="Mockup of Plant Paradise" />
      <p>
        (Note that some of the features of the mockup ended up different in the
        final product!)
      </p>
      <p>
        The key features of Plant Paradise are the sort, filter, add to cart,
        and remove from cart functionalities. Once users click the "sort"
        button, they will see a dropdown menu of features to sort by and can
        choose one at a time. When the user clicks on the climate or difficulty
        filters, they will see a dropdown menu of features to filter by. Users
        can click the add button to add to their cart. Inside the cart, they can
        continue to add multiple of the plant to the cart (which will display
        the current amount in the cart) or delete it.

      <h2>Part 3: Deployment</h2>
      <a href="https://development-three-orcin.vercel.app/"
        >This is the link to my deployed webpage!</a>
      <p>
        After deciding what features to include and what my page would look
        like, I coded the site! Some of the feautres of the final product ended
        up being different than in my quick mockup. For instance, the cart
        itself does not have an add/remove item feature, only the item cards.
        However, overall, I was able to use React states to carry out the most
        important functionalities: sorting, filtering, and keeping track of cart
        contents.

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>Overall, I believe my reactive webpage met the goals I set. I was succesfully able to utilize React states and components that respond to user functionality. The process made me much more comfortable with incorporating states into projects and showed me how essential they are for allowing a website to be reactive. I had a difficult time at first determining the best way to sort and filter, but once I had a more solid understanding of how to utilize states, I found these functionalities pretty straightforward to implement. I also found the competative analysis process inspiring when it came to picturing what I wanted my webpage to look like. </p>
